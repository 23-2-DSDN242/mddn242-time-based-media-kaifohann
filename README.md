## MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  

Wax, Oil and Sand by Hannah Kai Fong

I really struggled to come up with an idea for this assignment. Originally I went with 3 sets of rings that would appear as the hours/minutes/seconds increased, however I decided that this was difficult to read and would be too visually confusing. 
I scrapped this idea and decided to do some further research into the history of clocks. In my research, I found the earliest ones particularly interesting due to their simplicity. I came across an image that featured two candle clocks and an oil lamp via (MODERN NET REFERENCE) and I liked that they were so simple, but visually interesting due to the craftsmanship of the metal. I started thinking about how I could include these in my clock. 

Although recreating this seemed quite literal, abstract visual representations aren't my strength and I thought it would be fun to attempt to layer PNGs and code.

### THIS IS YOUR README

Hannah Kai Fong.

Your final version should have

1) A README.md file that includes:

* Your Clock Name
* Your Name
* A description of your overall design process that serves as your design journal (suggested: 300-600 words)

2) A 960x500 pixel preview.jpg that is a screenshot from your final version (you can use the '!' key to generate)

3) A modified index.html that updates all meta tags with your own settings for title / url / image / etc.
